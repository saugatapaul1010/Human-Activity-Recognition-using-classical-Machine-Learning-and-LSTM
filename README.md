### LSTMs for Human Activity Recognition

<img src='images/1.png'>


Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using smartphones dataset and an LSTM RNN. Classifying the type of movement amongst six categories:

1. WALKING,
2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS,
3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS,
4. SITTING,
5. STANDING,
6. LAYING.

Compared to the classical Machine Learning approaches, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory cells (LSTMs) require no or almost no feature engineering at all. Remember, we needed a lot of feature engineering to be done in for our Machine Learning models to achieve the accuracy it has! (96% max). In RNN-LSTMs, raw data can be fed directly into the neural network which acts like a black box, without ay feature engineering whatsoever! Other research in this topic of activity recognition uses a huge amount of feature engineering, which are signal processing approaches combined with classical Machine Learning/Data Science techniques. The approach here is rather very simple in terms of how much was the data preprocessed. Almost none. All we need to take care is how we design our Deep Learning models.

We will TensorFlow and Keras Libraries to demonstrate the usage of an LSTM, a type of Artificial Neural Network that can process sequential data / time series data.

### How the data was recorded?

Please watch this Youtube video link I have attached below to see how the data was recorded.

### Details about the input data

I will be using a special type of Recurrent Neural Network called LSTM on the dataset to learn (as a cellphone attached on the waist) to recognise what type of activity the user is doing. Few very important points about the dataset are as follows:

1. These sensor signals are preprocessed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width windows(sliding windows) of 2.56 seconds each with 50% overlap. ie., each window has 128 readings. 
2. From Each window, a feature vector was obtianed by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. In our dataset, each datapoint represents a window with different readings 
3. The accelertion signal was saperated into Body and Gravity acceleration signals(___tBodyAcc-XYZ___ and ___tGravityAcc-XYZ___) using some low pass filter with corner frequecy of 0.3Hz.

4. After that, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtian _jerk signals_ (___tBodyAccJerk-XYZ___ and ___tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ___). 

5. The magnitude of these 3-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidian norm. This magnitudes are represented as features with names like _tBodyAccMag_, _tGravityAccMag_, _tBodyAccJerkMag_, _tBodyGyroMag_ and _tBodyGyroJerkMag_.

6. Finally, We've got frequency domain signals from some of the available signals by applying a FFT (Fast Fourier Transform). These signals obtained were labeled with ___prefix 'f'___ just like original signals with ___prefix 't'___. These signals are labeled as ___fBodyAcc-XYZ___, ___fBodyGyroMag___ etc.,.

7. These are the signals that we got so far.
	+ tBodyAcc-XYZ
	+ tGravityAcc-XYZ
	+ tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
	+ tBodyGyro-XYZ
	+ tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
	+ tBodyAccMag
	+ tGravityAccMag
	+ tBodyAccJerkMag
	+ tBodyGyroMag
	+ tBodyGyroJerkMag
	+ fBodyAcc-XYZ
	+ fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
	+ fBodyGyro-XYZ
	+ fBodyAccMag
	+ fBodyAccJerkMag
	+ fBodyGyroMag
	+ fBodyGyroJerkMag


###  Y_Labels(Encoded)
+ In the dataset, Y_labels are represented as numbers from 1 to 6 as their identifiers.

	- WALKING as __1__
	- WALKING_UPSTAIRS as __2__
	- WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS as __3__
	- SITTING as __4__
	- STANDING as __5__
	- LAYING as __6__

### What is an RNN?

For details about what RNNs are please visit this wonderful article written by Andrej Karpathy titled "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks". As explained in [this article](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/), an RNN takes many input vectors to process them and output other vectors. It can be roughly pictured like in the image below, imagining each rectangle has a vectorial depth and other special hidden quirks in the image below. **In our case, the "many to one" architecture is used**: we accept time series of feature vectors (one vector per time step) to convert them to a probability vector at the output for classification. Note that a "one to one" architecture would be a standard feedforward neural network.

### What is an LSTM?

An LSTM is an improved RNN. It is more complex, but easier to train, avoiding what is called the vanishing gradient problem. I recommend [this article](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) for you to learn more on LSTMs.
